# weekly report 5

Used time this week ~6h

- This week I have peer reviewed another project & done some debugging on my FFT function.
- The program has not developed this week at all.
- This week I learned a lot since my project was peer reviewed. Ladtopi gave some informative feedback, especially on the code structure. This was helpful since my code can be badly organized.
- I still did not find out why my filtering algorithm is woring the opposite way to how it should. I also have not figured out how to test my "wavtools" librarys write_wav function. Also I have some trouble creating a clever system to process the audio data that's clear & memory efficient.
- Next week I'll focus on creating unit tests & debug my program.
