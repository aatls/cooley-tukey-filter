# weekly report 3

Used time this week ~15h

- This week I have implemented the radix-2 DIT algorithm for a vector of complex numbers. This works also in inverse.
- The program now has the main algorithm implemented.
- This week I learned about implementing algorithms from math equations. First I implemented the naive case of plain matrix multiplication DFT since I tought that it could replace the last few layers of FFT. Testing proved later that the naive dft is of no use in the FFT algorithm. Next I implemented the FFT. This turned out to be time consuming since I have trouble understanding the math behind the algorithm. It took some experimenting to find out what makes the FFT give the correct results.
- Next I'll implement the audio file handling & automate some tests.
