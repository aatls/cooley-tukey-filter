# weekly report 2

Used time this week ~16h

- This week I have done initial git management and studied the DFT and FFT.
- The implementation of the program has not yet been started.
- I have understood the principle and naive implementation of DFT (euler's formula helped a lot), and some parts of how the FFT reduces the time complexity of the process. I have also understood the principle of inverse DFT.
- It is still unclear to me how the FFT reduces the time complexity in the radix-2 DIT case. I do understand that the Fourier series of any signal will be periodic, but I don't fully understand how that information can be used to reduce the number of operations.
- Next week I'll start implementing the program without the full understanding of the mathematics behind the DFT.
