# weekly report 1

Used time this week ~5h

- This week I chose an algorithm and a problem to solve with it. I chose to implement FFT since it's widely used in signal processing which interests me, especially audio processing. Digital filter as an application came naturally with the FFT.
- I did not yet start the programming this week.
- I learned a lot about different signal processing algorithms that I considered for this course, especially the wavelet transform and FFT of course.
- It is still unclear how to actually begin implementing the Cooley-Tukey FFT as there is a lot I don't understand about the algorithm.
- Next week I'll try to understand the algorithm and start implementing the core of my project. I'll also start writing tests if I have time.
